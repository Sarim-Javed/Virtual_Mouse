# AI Virtual Mouse

A virtual mouse is a program that lets users control a computer using mouse commands without needing a real mouse. In some cases, it can even be thought of as hardware because it uses a regular web camera. Usually, a virtual mouse can be used with different input devices, such as an actual mouse or a keyboard. This kind of virtual mouse that uses a webcam functions with various image processing methods.
